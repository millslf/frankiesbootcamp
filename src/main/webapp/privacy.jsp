        <p>Hi there!<br>
        Weâ€™re so glad youâ€™re joining our small and friendly online exercise group. We believe in staying active and respecting your privacy. Hereâ€™s how we handle any personal information you share with us.</p>

        <p class="section-title">1. What Information We Collect</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name or nickname â€“ Just so we know whoâ€™s who.</li>
            <li>Email address or contact info â€“ If you choose to share it, for updates or reminders.</li>
            <li>Basic fitness activity details â€“ Like workouts completed, goals, or progress (if shared, e.g. from Strava).</li>
            <li>Comments, messages, or posts â€“ If thereâ€™s a group chat or shared space.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not collect sensitive personal data like health conditions, payment info, or anything unnecessary.</p>

        <p class="section-title">2. How We Use Your Information</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Help you track your progress (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Share updates or reminders (like new workout posts)</li>
            <li>Foster a fun and supportive group environment</li>
            <li>Improve the program experience based on feedback</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will never sell your information or use it for advertising.</p>

        <p class="section-title">3. Who Can See Your Info</p>
        <p>Only members of the group can see shared content like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The percentage of your weekly goal</li>
            <li>Previous distances completed if youâ€™ve covered the biggest distance for the week</li>
            <li>Your name or username</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="section-title">4. Your Choices</p>
        <p>Youâ€™re in control. You can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ask to have your information removed anytime</li>
            <li>Choose what you share or keep private</li>
            <li>Leave the group if you ever wish â€” no hard feelings!</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="section-title">5. Keeping Things Secure</p>
        <p>We do our best to keep your information safe, but since this is a friendly, informal program, please avoid sharing anything very personal or sensitive.</p>

        <p class="section-title">6. Questions or Concerns?</p>
        <p>Reach out anytime to <em>[insert your name or contact method, e.g., email or group admin handle]</em> if you have questions about privacy or how your information is used.</p>
